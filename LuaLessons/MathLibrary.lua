    Lua is a programming language that comes with a standard library that includes a "math" module. This module provides a set of mathematical functions that can be used in Lua programs. Here are some of the functions provided by the "math" module:

    math.abs(x): Returns the absolute value of x.
    math.acos(x): Returns the arccosine of x (in radians).
    math.asin(x): Returns the arcsine of x (in radians).
    math.atan(y, x): Returns the arctangent of y/x (in radians).
    math.ceil(x): Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
    math.cos(x): Returns the cosine of x (in radians).
    math.deg(x): Converts x from radians to degrees.
    math.exp(x): Returns e^x.
    math.floor(x): Returns the largest integer less than or equal to x.
    math.log(x [, base]): Returns the natural logarithm of x (or the logarithm of x to the given base).
    math.max(x1, x2, ...): Returns the maximum value among its arguments.
    math.min(x1, x2, ...): Returns the minimum value among its arguments.
    math.pow(x, y): Returns x^y.
    math.rad(x): Converts x from degrees to radians.
    math.random([m [, n]]): Returns a random integer between m and n (or between 1 and m if only one argument is given).
    math.randomseed(x): Sets the seed for the random number generator.
    math.sin(x): Returns the sine of x (in radians).
    math.sqrt(x): Returns the square root of x.
    math.tan(x): Returns the tangent of x (in radians).
    
    These functions can be used in Lua programs to perform various mathematical operations, such as calculating trigonometric functions, generating random numbers, and more.

--[[
    In Lua, the ":Play()" syntax is typically used to call a method named "Play" on an object that is represented by the preceding variable or expression.    
--]]

-- For example, if you have a variable named "mySound" that refers to an audio file or object, you can call the "Play" method on that object by using the following syntax:

mySound:Play()

-- This would instruct the audio object to start playing the associated sound or music. However, the exact behavior of the "Play" method would depend on how the audio object is implemented and what parameters are passed to the method.

-- Note that the ":" syntax is a shorthand for calling a method on an object with an implicit "self" argument. The equivalent syntax using the dot operator would be:

mySound.Play(mySound)

-- In this case, we need to explicitly pass the "self" argument to the method.

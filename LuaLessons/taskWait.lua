    In Lua, task.wait() is a function that is used in conjunction with coroutines to pause the execution of a coroutine for a specified amount of time, or until a certain condition is met.

    When a coroutine encounters the task.wait() function, it yields control back to the main program and allows other coroutines to execute. After the specified time has passed or the condition is met, the coroutine that called task.wait() will resume execution from where it left off.

function myCoroutine()
    print("Starting coroutine...")
    task.wait(5) -- wait for 5 seconds
    print("Coroutine resumed after waiting for 5 seconds")
end

-- create a new coroutine
myTask = task.create(myCoroutine)

-- start the coroutine
task.resume(myTask)

    In this example, the myCoroutine() function is defined to print a message, wait for 5 seconds using task.wait(), and then print another message. The task.create() function is used to create a new coroutine from myCoroutine(), and the task.resume() function is used to start the coroutine.

    When myCoroutine() encounters task.wait(5), it will yield control back to the main program and wait for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds have passed, it will resume execution and print the second message.

--[[
    In Lua, "\t" represents the tab character. When you include "\t" in a string, it tells the program to insert a horizontal tab character at that position in the string. This can be useful for formatting text, such as when you want to align columns of data.    
--]]

-- For example, consider the following code:
print("Name:\tAge:")
print("John\t25")
print("Mary\t30")

--[[
    This will produce output that looks like this:
    Name:   Age:
    John    25
    Mary    30
    
--]]

-- As you can see, the "\t" character has inserted a horizontal tab between the "Name:" and "Age:" columns, and between the name and age values in each row.

    In Lua, the :Destroy() method is typically used to delete or remove an object from memory.

    This method is commonly used in game development when you want to remove a game object or entity from the game world or when you want to clean up resources to prevent memory leaks.

-- Here's an example of how you might use :Destroy():
local gameObject = game:GetService("Workspace"):FindFirstChild("MyGameObject")

if gameObject then
    gameObject:Destroy()
    print("Object destroyed!")
else
    print("Object not found!")
end

-- In this example, the code searches for a game object named "MyGameObject" in the Workspace and destroys it if it exists. If the object is found and destroyed, the code will print "Object destroyed!". If the object is not found, the code will print "Object not found!".

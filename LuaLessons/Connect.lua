    In Lua, :Connect is a method used in the Roblox Lua API for connecting events to functions.

-- In Roblox Lua, the :Connect method is used to connect a function to an event, such as a button click or a player joining the game. Here's an example of how it works:

local button = Instance.new("TextButton")
button.Text = "Click me!"
button.Parent = game.Workspace

function onClicked()
    print("Button clicked!")
end

button.MouseButton1Click:Connect(onClicked)

--[[
    In this example, we create a new TextButton instance and set its Text property to "Click me!". We then define a function called onClicked that prints a message to the console. Finally, we use the :Connect method to connect the onClicked function to the MouseButton1Click event of the button.

    So when the user clicks the button, the onClicked function will be called and the message "Button clicked!" will be printed to the console.

Instance.new(className)


--[[
    where "className" is a string that specifies the name of the Roblox class for the object to be created. For example, if you wanted to create a new "Part" object, you would use the following code:    
--]]


local myPart = Instance.new("Part")

--[[
    This creates a new "Part" object and assigns it to the variable "myPart". You can then manipulate the properties of the object using Lua code, such as changing its position, size, color, or adding other components like scripts or behaviors to it.

    "Instance.new" is a powerful tool for creating custom game objects and building interactive experiences in Roblox games. It is commonly used by developers to create custom game assets and user interfaces, and to build complex gameplay mechanics using Lua scripting.

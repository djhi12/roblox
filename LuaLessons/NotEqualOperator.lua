-- In Lua, "~=" is the "not equal" operator. It is used to compare two values for inequality. For example:

if x ~= y then
    print("x is not equal to y")
  end

-- This code will print "x is not equal to y" if the value of x is not equal to the value of y. Note that the ~= operator performs a type-insensitive comparison, which means that it compares the values without regard to their data types.

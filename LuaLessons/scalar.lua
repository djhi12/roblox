    In Lua, a "scalar" typically refers to a single value that can be stored in a variable. This can include a number, a string, a boolean value, or the special value "nil" which represents the absence of a value. Scalars in Lua can be manipulated using various operators such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, ~=, <, >, <=, >=), and logical operators (and, or, not).

    In contrast, a "non-scalar" value in Lua would typically refer to a compound value that contains multiple values, such as a table, which can store other values as elements.

    It's worth noting that the term "scalar" is not a specific Lua term, but rather a more general programming term that is often used to refer to a single value, regardless of the programming language being used.

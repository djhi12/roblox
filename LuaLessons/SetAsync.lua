    SetAsync() is not a built-in function in Lua, but it is likely a custom function that has been defined in the Lua code you are working with.

    In general, the naming convention of Async usually indicates that the function is asynchronous, which means that it does not block the execution of other code while it is running. Asynchronous functions are useful when you need to perform long-running or time-consuming tasks without interrupting the rest of the program.

    Without more information about the specific Lua code you are working with, it is difficult to provide more detailed information about the SetAsync() function. However, in general, asynchronous functions often use a callback or a coroutine to handle the results of the task that is being performed.

    If you have access to the source code of the Lua program you are working with, you can look for the definition of the SetAsync() function to see how it is implemented and what it does.

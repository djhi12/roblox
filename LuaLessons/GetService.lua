-- GetService is not a built-in function in Lua, but it might refer to a method provided by the Roblox Lua API. In the context of Roblox Lua scripting, GetService is a method provided by the game object that is used to retrieve Roblox services, such as the Workspace, Players, ReplicatedStorage, and so on.

-- Here is an example of how to use GetService in Roblox Lua:

local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local player = Players.LocalPlayer
print(player.Name)

--[[
    In this example, we use GetService to retrieve the Players service from the game object. We then use the LocalPlayer property of the Players service to retrieve the local player's object, and finally, we print the player's name.

    Note that GetService is a method specific to Roblox Lua scripting and is not a standard Lua function.

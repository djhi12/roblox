--[[
    In Lua, the "not" operator is denoted by the symbol "~". It's used to negate a boolean value, meaning it returns the opposite of the value being evaluated.

    For example, if a variable "a" has a value of true, then the expression "not a" will return false. Similarly, if "a" has a value of false, then "not a" will return true.

-- Here's an example of using the "not" operator in Lua:
local a = true
local b = false

print(not a) -- prints "false"
print(not b) -- prints "true"

-- Note that the "not" operator has a higher precedence than the "and" and "or" operators in Lua, which means it will be evaluated before them. To override the default precedence, you can use parentheses to group expressions.

Project Name: 4 Seasons Islands

Concept and Design:
Decide on the overall theme and atmosphere of each island. For example, the spring island could be filled with blooming flowers and vibrant colors, while the winter island could have snowy landscapes and cozy cabins.

Plan the layout and size of each island. Consider including landmarks, natural elements, and unique features that capture the essence of each season.

Create a central hub or portal where players can choose which island they want to explore.

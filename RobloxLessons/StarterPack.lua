	You can use the objects and assets in the "StarterPack" folder in your Roblox game by referencing them in your code.	
--]]

-- For example, if you want to add the "StarterTool" to a player's backpack, you can use the following code:
-- Get the player's character
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:wait()

-- Find the StarterPack folder
local starterPack = game:GetService("StarterPack")

-- Clone the StarterTool object and add it to the player's backpack
local starterTool = starterPack.StarterTool:Clone()
starterTool.Parent = player.Backpack

-- This code gets the local player's character and finds the "StarterPack" folder using the game:GetService() method. It then clones the "StarterTool" object from the folder and adds it to the player's backpack by setting its parent to player.Backpack.


-- You can also modify the properties of objects in the "StarterPack" folder using code. For example, if you want to change the color of a brick in the folder, you can use the following code:
-- Find the StarterPack folder
local starterPack = game:GetService("StarterPack")

-- Find the brick object in the StarterPack folder
local brick = starterPack.Brick

-- Set the color of the brick
brick.Color = Color3.new(1, 0, 0) -- red

-- This code finds the "StarterPack" folder, gets the "Brick" object from the folder, and sets its color to red.


-- These are just a few examples of how you can use the objects and assets in the "StarterPack" folder in your Roblox game code. The possibilities are endless, and you can customize your game using the objects and assets in the folder in any way you like.

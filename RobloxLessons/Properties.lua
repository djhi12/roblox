In Roblox Studio, the "Properties" window is a panel that allows you to view and modify the properties of different objects in your game. It provides a convenient interface to change various settings and attributes of Roblox Studio elements such as parts, models, scripts, and more. The Properties window is an essential tool for customizing and fine-tuning the behavior and appearance of your game.

To access the Properties window in Roblox Studio, follow these steps:

1. Open Roblox Studio and load your game project.
2. Select the object or element you want to inspect or modify. This could be a part, model, script, or any other item in your game hierarchy.
3. With the object selected, locate the "Properties" tab in the upper-right corner of the Roblox Studio interface and click on it. This will open the Properties window.

Once the Properties window is open, you'll see a list of properties specific to the selected object. The properties can vary depending on the object type, but they generally include attributes like size, position, rotation, color, transparency, material, and various other settings that control the behavior and appearance of the object.

You can modify these properties by clicking on them and entering new values, selecting options from dropdown menus, or adjusting sliders. Changes made in the Properties window are usually reflected immediately in the game preview within Roblox Studio.

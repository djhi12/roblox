In Roblox Studio, the term "NetworkClient" refers to the client-side component of the Roblox multiplayer networking system. It represents the player's connection to the game server and is responsible for handling communication between the client and the server.

The NetworkClient object provides a set of properties and methods that allow developers to manage network-related tasks. Some of its key features include:

Remote Function/Event Invocation: The NetworkClient can be used to call remote functions or fire remote events on the server. These functions and events are defined in the server-side scripts and allow clients to interact with the game world or send data to the server.

Replicating Objects: The NetworkClient handles the replication of objects between the server and the client. This means that changes made to objects on the server are automatically synchronized with the client, ensuring that both sides have consistent data.

Latency and Network Statistics: The NetworkClient provides information about network statistics, such as latency and connection quality. Developers can use this information to optimize their game's networking performance or implement features that depend on network conditions.

Disconnect Handling: The NetworkClient handles disconnections from the server and provides events that developers can use to respond to these events. This allows for graceful handling of disconnections and implementing features like automatic reconnection.

To access the NetworkClient object in Roblox Studio, you can use the following code:

local networkClient = game:GetService("NetworkClient")

From there, you can use the various properties and methods available on the networkClient object to perform network-related tasks.

It's important to note that the NetworkClient object is only available on the client-side and cannot be accessed on the server. On the server, you would use the NetworkServer object instead to manage network-related tasks.

-- Example Program
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local networkClient = game:GetService("NetworkClient")
local remoteFunction = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("RemoteFunction")

local player = Players.LocalPlayer

-- Function to be called remotely
local function remoteFunctionHandler(...)
    print("Remote function called with arguments:", ...)
    -- Perform some logic or return a value
    return "Response from the client"
end

-- Bind the remote function handler
remoteFunction.OnClientInvoke = remoteFunctionHandler

-- Event handler for disconnections
local function handleDisconnect()
    print("Disconnected from the server")
    -- Implement reconnection logic if desired
end

-- Connect the disconnect event
networkClient.Disconnected:Connect(handleDisconnect)

-- Example of calling a remote function on the server
local response = remoteFunction:InvokeServer("Hello from the client")
print("Server response:", response)

In this example, we assume that you have a RemoteFunction object named "RemoteFunction" in the ReplicatedStorage, which is used to demonstrate the remote function invocation. You can replace it with your own RemoteFunction or RemoteEvent object.

The program starts by getting the NetworkClient object and the RemoteFunction object from the ReplicatedStorage. It also gets the LocalPlayer object from the Players service.

Next, a function named remoteFunctionHandler is defined to handle the remote function invocation. It prints the arguments received and returns a response to the server.

The program then binds the remoteFunctionHandler function to the OnClientInvoke event of the RemoteFunction object. This ensures that the function is called when the server invokes the remote function on the client.

Next, a function named handleDisconnect is defined to handle disconnections from the server. It simply prints a message indicating disconnection, but you can implement your own reconnection logic if needed.

The program connects the handleDisconnect function to the Disconnected event of the NetworkClient. This event fires when the client disconnects from the server.

Finally, an example of calling the remote function on the server is shown using the InvokeServer method of the RemoteFunction object. It passes a string argument and prints the response received from the server.

Remember to place this script in a LocalScript object in Roblox Studio and run it while testing the game to see the output in the output console.

LUA PROGRAMMING
Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. It was first created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes. Lua is used in a variety of applications, including video game development, mobile app development, web development, and more.

One of the key features of Lua is its simplicity and ease of use, which makes it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike. It is also highly flexible and can be easily integrated into other programming languages, such as C and C++. This has made it a popular choice for game developers who want to add scripting capabilities to their games.

Lua is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variables do not need to be declared with a specific data type. It also supports multiple data types, including strings, numbers, tables, and functions. Lua has a rich set of built-in functions and libraries, and it also supports metatables and metamethods, which allows for powerful object-oriented programming capabilities.

Overall, Lua is a versatile programming language that is well-suited for a variety of applications, particularly in game development and embedded systems. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice among developers.
